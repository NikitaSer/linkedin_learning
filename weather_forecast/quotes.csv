Jaskier | Destiny is just the embodiment of the soulâ€™s desire to grow.
Queen Calanthe | As in life, it is impossible always to be fully prepared for battle. Keep your sword close and keep moving.
Andrzej Sapkowski, 'The Witcher' | The sword of destiny has two edges. You are one of them.
Tissaia de Vries | There is not a person alive that does not look into the mirror and see some deformity. Except for us. We remake ourselves on our terms. The world has no say in it.
Yennefer | Destiny helps people believe there is an order.
Andrzej Sapkowski, 'The Last Wish' | Lesser, greater, middling, it's all the same. Proportions are negotiated, boundaries blurred. I'm not a pious hermit, I haven't done only good in my life. But if I'm to choose between one evil and another, then I prefer not to choose at all.
Yennefer | Who are we to challenge destiny, life was saved, the debt must be paid.
Andrzej Sapkowski, 'The Last Wish' | Evil is evil. Lesser, greater, middling... Makes no difference. The degree is arbitrary. The definition's blurred. If I'm to choose between one evil and another... I'd rather not choose at all.
Geralt of Rivia | People linked by destiny will always find each other.
Yennefer | A life holding dustpans while you brush off forgotten bones? That's not destiny. It's slow suicide.
Geralt of Rivia, 'Sword of Destiny' | Most often a dream, a wish, a desire, a yearning. Faith that there are no limits to possibility. And occasionally chance.
